	<p>How to benchmark</p>
	<p>There is no national benchmark for progression, because every organisation is structured differently. However, we can look at the industry’s performance by looking at the class pay gap and the proportion of those from working class backgrounds in professional roles. Neither of these are perfect, but they do show the broad strokes gaps in pay and progression by socio-economic background. Financial services can also consider work from our partners at the Bridge Group and City of London who found it takes those from lower socio-economic backgrounds 25% longer to progress through grades.</p>
