	<p>How to benchmark</p>
	<p>There is no national benchmark for progression, because every organisation is structured differently. However, we can look at the industryâ€™s performance by looking at the proportion of those from working class backgrounds in professional roles.</p> 
	<p>Research from the Creative Industries Policy and Evidence Centre (PEC) shows that currently, nearly 60% of those in leadership roles in the Creative Industries come from privileged (professional) backgrounds, showing a lack of representation at the top.</p>
